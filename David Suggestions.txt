Overall:

1. Minimize width in menu/navbar. Options are spaced out too far.

2. Add CSS Reset to remove extra padding, margins, etc. from each element.
   Helps your designs be more standard throughout. (Add suggestion on CraftPizza.html file).

3. For good web photos go to www.unsplash.com

4. Add cards throughout your web design. You can look up bootstrap cards.

5. Capitalize first letter of comments.

6. Great indentation! (I made minor updates.)

7. Great front end start overall.

8. Keep consistency in text for menu style. Either have all menu item's be like Home or like ORDER

9. Rename folder from Wireframe. Needs to be specific to the project. Maybe rename to Pizza Petes.

CraftPizza.html:

1. Line 32 - What is OG mean in your comments?

2. Update comments to be explain what each section is rather than where you got the code from.
For example: Menubar, Toppings Checkbox Section, Order Methods - Carry Out, Delivery, Doordash

3. Capitalize first letter of comments.
For example: Line 7 should be "Copied and pasted."

4. Put comments above the line of code it represents instead of below.
For example: Line 6 & Line 7 should switch.

5. Add comments detailing your Order Method dropdown menu.

6. Styling suggestion: Have background be white or a light gray before determining background.
Once you decide a good background color scheme you can copy those thoughout all of your webpages for consistency.

PizzaPastOrders.html:

1. H2 Account Info needs to be in div with corresponing form.

2. H2 Past Orders needs to be in div with corresponding information.

3. Background looks good. Have the same for menu bar or potentially make menubar have shadows or 3d to stand out.

4. Update title to page.

PizzaQK.html

1. Remove div's that are commented out. You are correct they aren't needed.

2. Good layout!

3. Minimize spacing between cards and spacing between cards and heading.

PizzaWeb.html

1. Good form design!

2. Remove brown background to match rest of pages once you determine a layout for the site.

3. Add states to dropdown.

4. Add pop up or page that contains terms and conditions. Doesn't have to be much, can start off as Lorem Ipsum.

5. Rename page better from PizzaWeb. Should be something like Registration or something.

PizzaWelcome.html

1. Rename to Index.html if this is the homepage. That is coding standard.

2. Looks good overall! Just stretch background image.
